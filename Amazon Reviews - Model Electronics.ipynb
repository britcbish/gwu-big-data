A few months back one of the chargers (only a year old) stopped working. I was able to find out through swapping with my other chargers that that the power adapter of the unit was faulty. I tried contacting La Crosse Technology about it and quickly learned that the company neither has any workable customer service line, nor dives a damn about its customers.<br /><br />As it turns out La Crosse Technology is a company in Wisconsin whose primary products are weather stations. These chargers that they ship are re-branded chargers produced by a different manufacturer (in other words La Crosse is not the OEM for these). Apparently the company does not give a penny for its consumer business. When you call their customer service line the system puts you on hold for the &#34;next available representative&#34; and a few minutes later directs you to a voice mailbox. I left lots of messages and nobody ever got back to me. I didn't give up and kept calling them. Eventually a rep picked up and after listening to my problem asked me to call the company's store assuring me that they will be able to help.<br /><br />I called and called the store line just to hit a voice mailbox after a few minutes of &#34;please wait on the line&#34; messages. Eventually somebody picked the line after a dozen calls or so. After asking me for my name, he burst into laughter. I asked him in my most dead-serious voice &#34;Did I say something funny?&#34;. That cut his laughter out. He then proceeded to tell me that I was &#34;very lucky&#34; that my call was answered since they dont &#34;normally answer calls&#34;. I was dismayed by this lack of professionalism! Nevertheless, I kept my composure and calmly explained my issue without responding to this insult. The guy told me that they probably have these power adapters but he would need to check on them and call me back. I refused to let him hang up on me citing the fact that for last few days nobody returned my calls and voice messages. He told me that he needed to walk to the other side of the warehouse to check on the item. I insisted that I would stay on the line and wait for him to come back. 15 minutes later he told me that they had the adapter on stock and I would get one shipped to me right away. He proceeded to collect my address and credit card number.<br /><br />It has been two months since this call. I still haven't received anything from La Crosse and my credit card has not been charged. I tried calling but all I got was the voicemail. Sadly, like most other Amazon customers, when I decided to buy the chargers, I looked at the aggregate customer rating for the product. Should I have read the negative reviews, I would have realized that this company has unbelievably bad customer service and attitude.<br /><br />I can not in good consciousness recommend this product due to the non-existant customer service behind it. When it works, it's fine, but when it breaks, you will be stuck with a $60 brick and no way to get it fixed, replaced, or getting any reasonable support. Think about it!voice messages.
